<h1><big>MINOR DETAIL</big></h1>

<h2><small>By JACK SHARKEY</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> Secretary of Defense,
flown in by special plane
from the new Capitol Building
in Denver, trotted down the
ramp with his right hand outstretched
before him.</p>

<p>At the base of the ramp his
hand was touched, clutched and
hidden by the right hand of General
"Smiley" Webb in a hearty
parody of a casual handshake.
General Webb did everything in
a big way, and that included
even little things like handshakes.</p>

<p>Retrieving his hand once
more, James Whitlow, the Secretary
of Defense, smiled nervously
with his tiny mouth, and
said,</p>

<p>"Well, here I am."</p>

<p>This statement was taken
down by a hovering circle of
news reporters, dispatched by
wireless and telephone to every
town in the forty-nine states, expanded,
contracted, quoted and
misquoted, ignored and misconstrued,
and then forgotten; all
this in a matter of hours.</p>

<p>The nation, hearing it, put
aside its wonted trepidations,
took an extra tranquilizer or
two, and felt secure once more.
The government was in good
hands.</p>

<hr />

<p>Leaving the reporters in a disgruntled
group beyond the cyclone-fence-and-barbed-wire
barriers surrounding Project
W, General Webb, seated
beside Whitlow in the back of
his private car, sighed and folded
his arms.</p>

<p>"You'll be amazed!" he chortled,
nudging his companion
with a bony elbow.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I expect so," said Whitlow,
clinging to his brief case
with both hands. It contained,
among other things, a volume of
mystery stories and a ham sandwich,
neatly packaged in aluminum
foil. Whitlow didn't want
to chance losing it. Not, at least,
until he'd eaten the sandwich.</p>

<p>"Of course, you're wondering
where I got the idea for my
project," said "Smiley" Webb,
adding, for the benefit of his
driver, "Keep your eyes on the
road, Sergeant! The WAC barracks
will still be there when you
get off duty!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," came a hollow
grunt from the front seat.</p>

<p>"Weren't you?" asked General
Webb, gleaming a toothy smile
in Whitlow's direction.</p>

<p>"Weren't I <i>what</i>?" Whitlow
asked miserably, having lost the
thread of their conversation due
to a surreptitious glance backward
at the WAC barracks in
their wake.</p>

<p>"Wondering about the project!"
snapped the general.</p>

<p>"Yes. We <i>all</i> were," said the
Secretary of Defense, appending
somewhat tartly, "That's why
they <i>sent</i> me here."</p>

<p>"To be sure. To be sure," General
Webb muttered. He didn't
much like tartness in responses,
but the Secretary of Defense,
unfortunately, was hardly a
subordinate, and therefore not
subject to the general's choler.
Silly little ass! he said to himself.
Rather liking the sound of
the words&mdash;albeit in his mind&mdash;he
repeated them over again,
adding embellishments like
"pompous" and "mousy" and
"squirrel-eyed." After three or
four such thoughts, the general
felt much better.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> thought the whole thing up,
myself," he said, proudly.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd stop being so
ambiguous," Whitlow protested
in a small voice. "Just what <i>is</i>
this project? How does it work?
Will it help us win the war?"</p>

<p>"<i>Sssh!</i>" said the general, jerking
a quivering forefinger perpendicular
before pursed lips.
"Security!"</p>

<p>He closed one eye in a broad
wink and wriggled a thumb in
the direction of the driver. "He's
only cleared for Confidential
material," said the general, his
tone casting aspersions on the
sergeant's patriotism, ancestry
and personal hygiene. "This
project is, of course, <i>Top Secret</i>!"
He said the words reverently,
his face going all noble
and brave. Whitlow half-expected
him to remove his hat, but he
did not.</p>

<hr />

<p>They drove onward, then, in
silence, until they passed by a
large field, in the center of
which Whitlow could discern the
outlines of an immense bull's-eye,
in front of a tall, somewhat
rickety khaki-colored reviewing
stand, draped in tired bunting.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Whitlow,
relinquishing his grip on
his brief case long enough to
point toward the field.</p>

<p>"<i>Ssssh!</i>" said "Smiley" Webb.
"You'll find out in a matter of
hours."</p>

<p>"Many hours?" Whitlow asked,
thinking of the ham sandwich.</p>

<p>General Webb consulted a
magnificent platinum timepiece
anchored to his thick hairy
wrist by a stout leather strap.</p>

<p>"In exactly one hour, thirty-seven
minutes, and forty-three-point-oh-oh-nine
seconds!"
he said, proudly.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Whitlow sighed.
"You're certainly running this
thing&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;in an
efficient manner."</p>

<p>"Thank <i>you</i>!" General Webb
glowed. "We like to think so,"
he added modestly.</p>

<hr />

<p>Passwords, signs, countersigns,
combination-locks and
electronic recognition signals
were negotiated one by one, until
Whitlow was despairing of
ever getting into the heart of
Project W. He said as much to
General Webb, who merely flashed
the grin which gave him his
nickname, and opened a final
door.</p>

<p>For a moment, Whitlow
thought he was going deaf. The
shrill roar of screeching metal
and throbbing dynamos that
pounded at his eardrums began
to fuddle his mind, until General
Webb handed him a small
cardboard box&mdash;also stamped,
like every door and wall in the
place, "Top Secret"&mdash;in which
his trembling fingers located
two ordinary rubber earplugs,
which he instantly put to good
use.</p>

<p>"There she is!" said General
Webb, proudly, gesturing over
the railing of the small balcony
upon which they stood. "The
Whirligig!"</p>

<p>"What?" called Secretary of
Defense Whitlow, shaking his
head to indicate he hadn't heard
a word.</p>

<p>Somewhat piqued, but resigned,
General Webb leaned his
wide mouth nearly up against
Whitlow's small pink plugged
ear, and roared the same information
at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>Whitlow, a little stunned by
the volume despite the plugs,
nodded wearily, to indicate that
he'd heard, then asked, in a high,
piping voice, "What's it for?"</p>

<p>Webb's eyes bulged in their
sockets. "Great heavens, man,
can't you <i>see</i>?" He gestured
down at his creation, his baby,
his project, as though it were
self-evident what its function
was.</p>

<p>Whitlow strained his eyes to
divine anything that might give
a clue as to just what the government
had been pouring money
into for the past eight months.
All he saw was what appeared
to be a sort of ferris-wheel, except
that it was revolving in a
horizontal plane. The structure
was completely enclosed in metal,
and was whirling too fast for
even the central shaft to be anything
but a hazy, silver-blue
blur.</p>

<p>"I see it," he shouted, squeakily.
"But I don't understand it!"</p>

<p>"Come with me," said General
Webb, re-opening the door at
their backs. He was just about
to step through when, with a
quick blush of mortification, he
remembered the "Top Secret"
earplugs. Hastily, averting his
face lest the other man see his
embarrassment, he returned his
plugs to their box, and did the
same with Whitlow's.</p>

<p>Whitlow was glad when the
door closed behind them.</p>

<p>"My office is this way," said
Webb, striding off in a stiff military
manner.</p>

<p>Whitlow, with a forlorn shrug,
could do nothing but clutch his
brief case and follow.</p>

<hr />

<p>"It's this way," General Webb
began, once they were seated
uncomfortably in his office.
From a pocket in his khaki
jacket, Webb had produced a
big-bowled calabash pipe, and
was puffing its noxious gray
fumes in all directions while he
spoke. "Up until the late fifties,
war was a simple thing ..."</p>

<p>Oh, not the March of Science
Speech! said Whitlow to himself.
He knew it by heart. It was
the talk of the Capitol, and the
nightmare of military strategists.
As the general's voice
droned on and on, Whitlow barely
listened. The general, Top Secret
or no Top Secret, was
divulging nothing that wasn't
common knowledge from the
ruins of Philadelphia to the
great Hollywood crater ...</p>

<p>All at once, weapons had gotten
<i>too</i> good. That was the whole
problem. Wars, no matter what
the abilities of the death-dealing
guns, cannon, rifles, rockets or
whatever, needed one thing on
the battlefield that could not be
turned out in a factory: Men.</p>

<p>In order to win a war, a country
must be vanquished. In order
to vanquish a country, soldiers
must be landed. And that was
precisely wherein the difficulty
lay: landing the soldiers.</p>

<p>Ships were nearly obsolete in
this respect. Landing barges
could be blown out of the water
as fast as they were let down
into it.</p>

<p>Paratroops were likewise
hopeless. The slow-moving troop-carrying
planes daren't even
peek above the enemy's horizon
without chancing an onslaught
of "thinking" rockets that
would stay on their trail until
they were molten cinders falling
into the sea.</p>

<p>So someone invented the supersonic
carrier. This was
pretty good, allowing the planes
to come in high and fast over
the enemy's territory, as fast as
the land-to-air missiles themselves.
The only drawback was
that the first men to try parachuting
at that speed were battered
to confetti by the slipstream
of their own carriers.
That would not do.</p>

<p>Next, someone thought of the
capsules. Each man was packed
into a break-proof, shock-proof,
water-proof, wind-proof plastic
capsule, and ejected safely beyond
the slipstream area of the
carriers, at which point, each
capsule sprouted a silken chute
that lowered the enclosed men
gently down into range of the
enemy's rocket-fire ...</p>

<p>This plan was scrapped like
the others.</p>

<p>And so, things were at a
stalemate. There hadn't been a
really good skirmish for nearly
five years. War was hardly anything
but a memory, what with
both sides practically omnipotent.
Unless troops could be
landed, war was downright impossible.
And, no one could land
troops, so there was no war.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Whitlow
<i>liked</i> the state of affairs. To be
Secretary of Defense during a
years-long peace was a soft job
to top all soft jobs. And Whitlow
didn't much like war. He'd
rather live peacefully with his
mystery stories and ham sandwiches.</p>

<p>But the Capitol, under the relentless
lobbying of the munitions
interests, was trying to
find a way to get a war started.</p>

<p>They <i>had</i> tried simply bombing
the other countries, but it
hadn't worked out too well: the
other countries had bombed
back.</p>

<p>This plan had been scrapped
as too dangerous.</p>

<p>And then, just when all seemed
lost, when it looked as though
mankind was doomed to eternal
peace ...</p>

<p>Along came General "Smiley"
Webb.</p>

<p>"Land troops?" he'd said, confidently,
"nothing easier. With
the government's cooperation, I
can have our troops in any country
in the world, safely landed,
within the space of one year!"</p>

<p>Congress had voted him the
money unanimously, and off he'd
gone to work at Project W. No
one knew <i>quite</i> what it was
about, but the general had
seemed so self-assured that&mdash; Well,
they'd almost forgotten
about him until some ambitious
clerk, trying to balance at least
<i>part</i> of the budget, had discovered
a monthly expenditure to an
obscure base in the southwest
totalling some millions of dollars.
Perfunctory checking had
brought out the fact that
"Smiley" Webb had been drawing
this money every month, and
hadn't as much as mailed in a
single progress report.</p>

<p>There'd been swift phone-calls
from Denver to Project W, and,
General Webb informed them,
not only was all the money to be
accounted for, but so was all the
time and effort: the project was
completed, and about to be tested.
Would someone like to come
down and watch?</p>

<p>Someone would.</p>

<hr />

<p>And thus it was that James
Whitlow, with mystery stories
and ham sandwich, had taken
the first plane from the Capitol ...</p>

<p>"... when all at once, I
thought: Speed! Endurance!
<i>That</i> is the problem!" said
Webb, breaking in on Whitlow's
reverie.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?" said the
Secretary of Defense.</p>

<p>Webb whacked the dottle out
of his pipe into a meaty palm,
tossed the smoking cinders
rather carelessly into a waste-basket,
and leaned forward to
confront the other man face to
face, their noses almost nudging.</p>

<p>"Why are parachutes out?" he
snapped.</p>

<p>"They go too slow," said Whitlow.</p>

<p>"Why do we use parachutes at
all?"</p>

<p>"To keep the men from getting
killed by the fall."</p>

<p>"Why does a fall kill the
men?"</p>

<p>"It&mdash; It breaks their bones
and stuff."</p>

<p>"<i>Bah!</i>" Webb scoffed.</p>

<p>"Bah?" reiterated Whitlow.
"Bah?"</p>

<p>"Certainly bah!" said the general.
"All it takes is a little
training."</p>

<hr />

<p>"All <i>what</i> takes?" said Whitlow,
helplessly.</p>

<p>"Falling, man, falling!" the
general boomed. "If a man can
fall safely from ten feet&mdash; Why
not from ten times ten feet!?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Whitlow, "increasing
height accelerates the
<i>rate</i> of falling, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Poppycock!</i>" the general
roared.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Whitlow,
somewhat cowed.</p>

<p>"Muscle-building. That's the
secret. Endurance. Stress.
Strain. Tension."</p>

<p>"If&mdash; If you say so ..." said
Whitlow, slumping lower and
lower in his chair as the general's
massive form leaned precariously
over him. "But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of <i>course</i> you are puzzled,"
said the general, suddenly chummy.
"Anyone would be. Until
they realized the use to which
I've put the Whirligig!"</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes, I suppose so ..."
said Whitlow, thinking longingly
of his ham sandwich, and its
crunchy, moist green smear of
pickle relish.</p>

<p>"The first day&mdash;" said General
Webb, "it revolved at <i>one</i>
gravity! They withstood it!"</p>

<p>"What did? Who withstood?
When?" asked Whitlow, with
much confusion.</p>

<p>"The men!" said the general,
irritably. "The men in the
Whirligig!"</p>

<p>Whitlow jerked bolt upright.
"There are <i>men</i> in that thing?"
It's not possible, he thought.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Webb, soothingly.
"But they're all right.
They've been in there for thirty
days, whirling around at one
gravity more each day. We have
constant telephone communication
with them. They're all feeling
fine, just fine."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Whitlow said, weakly.</p>

<p>General Webb had him firmly
by the arm, and was leading him
out of the office. "We must get
to the stands, man. Operation
Human Bomb in ten minutes."</p>

<p>"Bomb?" Whitlow squeaked,
scurrying alongside Webb as the
larger man strode down the
echoing corridor.</p>

<p>"A euphemism, of course,"
said Webb. "Because they will
fall much like a bomb does. But
they will not explode! No, they
will land, rifles in hand, ready
to take over the enemy territory."</p>

<p>"Without parachutes?" Whitlow
marveled.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the general,
leading the way out into the
blinding desert sunlight. "You
see," he remarked, as they
strolled toward the heat-shimmering
outlines of the reviewing
stand, its bunting hanging limp
and faded in the dry, breezeless
air, "it's really so simple I'm astonished
the enemy didn't think
of it first. Though, of course,
I'm glad they didn't&mdash; Ha! ha!"
He oozed self-appreciation.</p>

<p>"Ha ha," repeated Whitlow,
with little enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"When one is whirled at one
gravity, you see, the wall&mdash;the
outside rim&mdash;of the Whirligig,
becomes the floor for the men
inside. Each day, they have
spent up to ten hours doing
nothing but deep knee-bends,
and eating high protein foods.
Their legs will be able to withstand
<i>any</i> force of landing. If
they can do deep knee-bends at
thirty gravities&mdash;during which,
of course, each of them weighed
nearly three tons&mdash;they can
jump from any height and survive.
Good, huh?"</p>

<hr />

<p>Whitlow was worried as they
clambered up into the stands.
There seemed to be no one about
but the two of them.</p>

<p>"Who else is coming?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Just us," said Webb. "I'm the
only one with a clearance high
enough to watch this. You're
only here because you're <i>my</i>
guest."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" said Whitlow, observing
the heat-baked wide-open
spaces extending on all sides of
the reviewing stand and bull's-eye,
"the men on this base can
surely watch from almost anywhere
not beyond the horizon."</p>

<p>"They'd <i>better</i> not!" was the
general's only comment.</p>

<p>"Well," said Whitlow, "what
happens now?"</p>

<p>"The men that were in that
Whirligig have&mdash;since you and
I went to my office to chat&mdash;been
transported to the airfield, from
which point they were taken
aloft&mdash;" he consulted his watch,
"five minutes, and fifty-five-point-six
seconds ago."</p>

<p>"And?" asked Whitlow, casually
unbuckling the straps of
his brief case and slipping out
his sandwich.</p>

<p>"The plane will be within
bomb vector of this target in
just ten seconds!" said Webb,
confidently.</p>

<p>Whitlow listened, for the next
nine seconds, then, right on
schedule, he heard the muted
droning of a plane, high up.
Webb joggled him with an elbow.
"They'll fall faster than any
known enemy weapon can track
them," he said, smugly.</p>

<p>"That's fortunate," said Whitlow,
munching desultorily at his
sandwich. "Bud dere's wud thig
budduhs bee."</p>

<p>"Hmmf?" asked the general.</p>

<p>Whitlow swallowed hastily. "I
say, there's one thing bothers
me."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked the general.</p>

<p>"Well, it's just that gravity is
centripetal, you know, and the
Whirligig is centrifugal. I wondered
if it might not make some
sort of difference?"</p>

<p>"Bah!" said General Webb.
"Just a minor detail."</p>

<p>"If you say so," Whitlow
shrugged.</p>

<p>"There they come!" shouted
the general, jumping to his feet.</p>

<p>Whitlow, despite his misgivings,
found that he, too, was on
his feet, staring skyward at the
tiny dots that were detaching
themselves from the shining
bulk of the carrier plane. As he
watched, his heart beating madly,
the dots grew bigger, and
soon, awfully soon, they could be
distinguished as man-shaped,
too.</p>

<p>"There's&mdash; There's something
wrong!" said the general.
"What's that they're all shouting?
It <i>should</i> be 'Geronimo' ..."</p>

<p>Whitlow listened. "It sounds
more like 'Eeeeeyaaaaa'," he
said.</p>

<p>And it was.</p>

<p>The sound grew from a distant
mumble to a shrieking roar,
and the next thing, each man
had landed upon the concrete-and-paint
bull's-eye before the
reviewing stand.</p>

<p>Whitlow sighed and re-buckled
his brief case.</p>

<p>The general moaned and fainted.</p>

<p>And the men of the Whirligig,
all of whom had landed on the
target head-first, did nothing,
their magnificently muscled legs
waving idly in a sudden gentle
gust of desert breeze.</p>

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
